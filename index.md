## Projects

`2021`
__GlucoseAPP__, Code for an interactive shiny app *CGM data visualization tool* supporting manuscript *Diabetes risk stratification using continuous glucose monitoring profiles and machine learning*
> This online web tool at [sshsphdemos.shinyapps.io/GlucoseAPP/](https://sshsphdemos.shinyapps.io/GlucoseAPP/) visualises individual CGM (continuous glucose monitoring) data and its projection to a lower-dimensional space of features representing centrality, spread, size and duration of glycemic excursions and the circadian cycle. The features are summarised in histogram form and relationships with demographic variables are explored. Interactive controls are available at the side panel to customise viewing interval, patient of interest, etc. In the manuscript, we base on features calculated in this tool and then use principal components analysis and k means to cluster patients’ records into one of four glucotypes, and analyze cluster membership using multinomial logistic regression.

`2021`
__BayesPC__, R package for manuscript *Bayesian clustering using random effects models and predictive projections*
> We consider a Bayesian clustering method that combines linear mixed models and predictive projections. For each observation, we consider a predictive replicate in which only a subset of the random effects is shared between the observation and its replicate, with the remainder being integrated out using the conditional prior. Predictive projections are then defined in which the number of distinct values taken by the shared random effects is finite, in order to obtain different clusters. This R package contains main functions to implement the algorithm, and a pedagogical example as a guide.

`2020`
__identifyCOVID__, Supporting R code for manuscript *Identifying COVID-19 cases in outpatient settings*
> This paper reports tools to classify patients based on symptom profiles based on 236 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive cases and 564 controls, accounting for the time course of illness using generalised multivariate logistic regression.
